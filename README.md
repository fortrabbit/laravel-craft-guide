# *What? There is no middleware in Craft?*

At the [Berlin Craft Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Berlin-Craft-CMS-Meetup/) last month, I had a conversion with [Lauren](https://twitter.com/flatpooks) about Laravel and Craft/Yii. We talked about the similarities and the differences between the two frameworks.

I thought it would be a great idea to give developers with a background in Laravel, an introduction to Craft plugin development, by comparing the concepts both implement.

When I started with the outline, I noticed quickly this would be a huge effort for a single person. I'm still undecided about the style and the structure, but I'm confident others with experience in both "frameworks" are interested contributing - that's why this GitHub repo exist.
